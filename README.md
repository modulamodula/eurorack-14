This an attempt to build various basic analog synthesizer parts in the Eurorack form-factor. It is currently using clones of Curtis Electromusic ICs. Why, you might ask? Mostly just for fun and education.

The circuits are mostly based on the datasheets and various circuits around the web. In particular the triangle to sine conversion in the VCO uses part of Ray Wilson's VCO circuit.

Build at your own risk!

Note that these are currently only partially tested and working.
